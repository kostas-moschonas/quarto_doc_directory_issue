This is a quarto document within an R project, I did not create a quarto project.

I want to source the script `calculations.R` and use the stored variable (in this case `mean_var1`) in the document, without copy pasting the code of that script.

```{r}

getwd()
```

```{r}
#| include: false
source("R/calculations_script.R")
```

The mean of variable 1 is `r mean_var1`

Try rendering the document with and without the `_quarto.yml` file in the root directory.
